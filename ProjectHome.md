Taslak is a draft implementation project For [XMDL](http://code.google.com/p/xmdl/).

Taslak intends to create a sample platform implementation that will be integrated as a target platform into XMDL. It is initially based on the Struts2 achetype supplied by [Appfuse 2](http://appfuse.org/display/APF/Home). But this structure may be changed.

Source code is subject to massive change since this project is used to discuss and shape new ideas.
