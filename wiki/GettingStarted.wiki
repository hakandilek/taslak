This document describes how to run the *_taslak_* application from scratch.

= Steps =

  * svn checkout https://taslak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ taslak --username <your-user-name>
  * *cd taslak*
  * in the file *"/taslak/pom.xml"* change the username and password. It default uses mysql.
{{{
	<jdbc.username>root</jdbc.username>
	<jdbc.password>*test1*</jdbc.password>
}}}
  * run the command to create the database and insert sample data. 
{{{  
mvn
}}}
  * We can now deploy our project by using maven-jetty-plugin.In the /taslak/web/ directory run the command:
{{{
mvn jetty:run-war
}}}
  * You can now browse to the http://localhost:8080/. 
    * User name : *admin* 
    * Password  : *admin*

  * If you want to make jetty see the changes on the fly, you should follow these steps.
  
    * in the directory */taslak/* run the command *mvn war:inplace*
	* delete the directory */taslak/web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib*
	* remove the *struts.xml* file in */taslak/web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/*
	* now you can deploy your application by the command *mvn jetty:run* in the */taslak/web/* directory.
	
== Additional Notes ==

  * If you alter anything in the /taslak/core/ directory, you should run the command under */taslak/core/* directory.
{{{
mvn install
}}}
  * Now on the *web* module you can see the changes.
